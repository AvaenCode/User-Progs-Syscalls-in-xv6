# How to Create User Progs Syscalls in xv6

The following document should provide as a resource on how to add your own user programs and syscalls to the xv6 OS. This tutorial does **NOT** cover how syscalls or user programs work in depth, as this is more of an implementation tutorial than a conceptual one. 

Either way I hope that this tutorial serves useful to anyone who is looking to customize their xv6 OS!

Sincerely,
Thomas
